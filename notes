previously given prompt:
I want to make an assistant that takes text input and stores the information somewhere safe. Then, this assistant will answer questions both about the information previously provided and just general information it knows already.
What tech stacks should be used? This is only a planning phase.

For your text-based assistant that stores and retrieves information, I'd recommend the following tech stack:
Frontend:
React.js or Next.js - For building a responsive UI
TypeScript - For type safety
Tailwind CSS - For styling
Backend:
Node.js with Express - For API endpoints
MongoDB or PostgreSQL - For persistent storage
Vector database (like Pinecone or Chroma) - For semantic search capabilities
AI/NLP:
OpenAI API or Hugging Face models - For natural language understanding
LangChain or similar - For context management and retrieval
Authentication:
Auth0 or NextAuth - For secure user authentication
Deployment:
Vercel or Netlify - For frontend hosting
Railway or Render - For backend deployment
Docker - For containerization
This stack provides a good balance of developer experience, scalability, and the specialized tools needed for AI-powered information retrieval and storage.
